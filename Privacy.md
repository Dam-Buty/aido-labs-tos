# AIDO Labs privacy policy

Our **Slackbots** do not access personnally identifying information, unless strictly required for their proper operation.

This is the data our **Slackbots** access through the Slack API. Any bot accessing more data will be listed at the end of the present document.

* Team Slack ID (for example `T0X0X0X0`)
* User Slack ID (for example `UW0TM8`)
* History of usage of the **Slackbot** (for example, the I Ching Bot retains your current and past readings)

You can request all data concerning your Slack workspace to be deleted. Simply send me an email at dam.buty@gmail.com including your Team Slack ID, and allow 48 hours for execution of your request.

## Bots accessing specific data

_Currently AIDO Labs does not operate any bot requiring more data than the items listed above._
